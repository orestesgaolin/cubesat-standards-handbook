\subsection{Project Management Documents}

\subsubsection{Mission Statement Document}
\label{app:Mission Statement Document}

The mission statement document is the single document generated by the project initiator that defines the purpose and objectives of the mission together with key performance requirements and constraints.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Mission Statement Document}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l p{8cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Content} \\
\midrule
Introduction & Brief overview on the mission idea and the scope of the document. \\
Background & Scientific or commercial need that sparked the mission idea, and that elaborates on the feasibility of the realization. \\
Purpose and Objectives & Presents the desired overall outcome of the project, the individual objectives to be achieved, and the formulation of a concise and catchy mission statement. \\
Key Performance Parameters & Lists the key performance parameters to be fulfilled by the project. For example, the ground sample distance for an earth observation mission. \\
Key Constraints & Lists the key technical and programmatic constraints to be applied to the project. \\
Risks & Initial assessment of the technical and programmatic risks. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Project Requirements Document}
\label{app:Project Requirements Document}

The project requirements document is the key document that the top-level customer provides to potential suppliers in the frame of an invitation to tender or request for proposal.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Project Requirements Document}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l p{8cm}}

\subsubsection{Project Management Plan}
\label{app:Project Management Plan}

The project management plan is the top level project plan which defines the project management approach and methodology to be used throughout the life cycle of the project, together with an overview of all elements of project management disciplines. It provides references to the separate system engineering, product assurance, and risk management plans, which together make up the total planning documentation used to implement a project.
